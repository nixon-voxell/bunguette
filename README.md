## Gameplay

Feed the hungry! You and your partner have opened a generous shop that provides free food to starving animals.
But be warnedâ€”when they're not well-fed, these hungry animals become aggressive! Your job is to keep them full and satisfied.

### Core Mechanics

- Each level, you'll be given some raw ingredients and cooking appliances.
- You will need to build defense towers by cooking those raw ingredients using the appliances.
- Each tower has its own recipe and requires different amounts of ingredients.
- With the ingredients, you will be able to craft tower (instantly) and place them on the ground.
- Each well-fed enemy will in return provide you extra raw ingredients for you to build more towers.
- Towers have unlimited ammo but can be attacked by hungry animals.
- Enemies arrive in waves at fixed intervals.
- Since your character is made of food (a baguette and a polo bun), you can toss tiny versions of yourself (mini baguettes or polo buns) at enemies to keep them fed!

#### Level 1

- Enemy: Rats
- Raw ingredients: Corn
- Appliances: Rotisserie, Wok 
- Tower: Cannon Tower (Popcorn), Gun Tower (Roasted Corn)

#### How to win?

Survive all 3 waves in the level by preventing the hungry animals from reaching the blue portal!
